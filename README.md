# COVID-19 Causal Modeling Using Twitter Data

### Introduction: 
This project is an implementation of the study presented in the paper, [Causal Modeling of Twitter Activity during COVID-19](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/8/4/85#:~:text=Evident%20correlations%20between%20these%20variables,one%20confirmed%20COVID%2D19%20case). The COVID-19 pandemic, declared on March 11, 2020, introduced unprecedented challenges, catching governments and businesses off guard. The resulting shutdowns and slow, uncertain government responses highlighted the need for better tools to understand and manage public sentiment during such crises.

Our project aims to explore and validate the causal relationships between the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and public response as reflected in Twitter activity and sentiment. We seek to understand how the public's reaction to various stages of the pandemic can inform more effective communication strategies and policy decisions.

### Objectives: 
The primary goal of our project is to identify and analyze causal associations between COVID-19 pandemic patterns and Twitter activity and sentiment. By achieving this, we aim to:

1. Understand Public Reaction: Gain insights into how the public responds to different phases and facets of the pandemic.

2. Guide Government and Business Responses: Provide actionable information to help governments and businesses tailor their communication strategies and policy decisions in line with public sentiment.

3. Enhance Policy Making: Uncover the causal links between pandemic developments (such as infection rates and mortality) and public sentiment, enabling policymakers to anticipate and address public concerns more effectively.

4. Improve Risk Communication: Facilitate the transition of risk communication strategies from alerting the public to reassuring them, especially in managing the spread of accurate information during critical times.

5. Support Crisis Management for Businesses: Offer insights for businesses to adjust their strategies and communications, aligning with the evolving public sentiment during the pandemic.

### Data Sources: 
- COVID-19 Data Repository by Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins Univeristy
- Twitter API

### Proposed Methods/Tools:
We will utilize Python, Causalnex, Scikit-learn and Transformers (Will add more as needed)

### Status:
Project is in the initial stages and will be updated as it progresses.
